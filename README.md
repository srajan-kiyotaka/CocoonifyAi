# CocoonifyAi
We are trying to make a AI capsule which contains all the basic and very useful Ai algorithm, ML Models, DL Models and many more. All these Models are prebuild on the dataset and the user just have to import the library and can use any model into the code without creating a new model, or training/testing on different architecture or datasets, just use the library and write wonderful programs. All the models will be light weight. User can also see the data analysis of the dataset which is used to train the model as well as the model architecture. There are many more features but this the basic idea behind the library.
